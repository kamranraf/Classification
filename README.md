# Classification
Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction Dataset

heart.csv is a dataset that contains heart disease classification data with 213 entries.

I have attempted to apply three classification models to the dataset and assess the performance of each model. 

Below are some of the actions taken in the classification.ipynb notebook:
- Import dataset and libraries
- General information about dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checking for missing data
- Apply logistic regression model
- Apply random forest model
- Apply K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) model

The models were assessed using:
- Confusion matrix
- Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score
- ROC (Receiver operating characteristic) curves
  -ROC area under the curve (AOC)
